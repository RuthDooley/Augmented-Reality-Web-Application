# Introduction
This repo demonstrates the development of a basic web app to demonstrate the use cases of augmented reality. The development involves using ar.js. This application was the submission for assignment 1 for the 4th year module "Augmented and Virtual Reality" with the code "COMP47930".

# Deployment
How to run this application:
1. Download node.js
2. Download, install and configure npm for mac. I did so with this https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac
3. You must use ar.js with a version of local host. I am using the solution to this stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38497334/how-to-run-html-file-on-localhost
4. cd to the location of the index file: cd "/Users/ruthdooley/Desktop/Computer Science Folder/Semester 1/ARVR"
5. Run: http-server
6. When the local host is running go to: http://localhost:8080/

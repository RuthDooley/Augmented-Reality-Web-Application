# ar.js-web-app
Creating a web app and to display the applications of augmented reality. I will be using ar.js in doing so.

How to Run my application:
1. Download node.js
2. Download, install and configure npm for mac. I did so with this https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac
3. You must use ar.js with a version of local host. I am using the solution to this stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38497334/how-to-run-html-file-on-localhost
4. cd to the location of the index file: cd /Users/ruthdooley/arvr/ar.js-web-app
5. Run: http-server
6. When the local host is running go to: http://localhost:8080/
